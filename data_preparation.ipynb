       "\"In 1945, Luke Bomberger's life took an unexpected turn post-high school. He joined the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) as a seagoing cowboy, delivering animals to war-torn Europe. He and his friend Don embarked on their first mission to Greece, caring for 335 horses. Luke turned 18 en route, qualifying his service as his military draft duty. Over two years, he completed nine trips, more than any other seagoing cowboy, experiencing Europe and China. Despite dangers like nearly falling overboard, Luke also enjoyed on-board leisure activities. This unique experience significantly broadened his worldview and influenced his later life, including hosting international students and exchange visitors.\""
